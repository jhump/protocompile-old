# NOTICE
_This repo is in the process of moving to another org in GitHub._ No more activity will happen here. If you have questions about it or the contents herein (including about the grammar), feel free to open an issue. Once the movement is finalized, I will change this personal repo into a _fork_ of the new home and add more details/links to this README.

# protocompile
A parsing/linking engine for protocol buffers; the guts for a pure Go replacement of protoc.

This project is still under construction. But it will eventually be a high-powered replacement for [`github.com/jhump/protoreflect/desc/protoparse`](https://godoc.org/github.com/jhump/protoreflect/desc/protoparse).
